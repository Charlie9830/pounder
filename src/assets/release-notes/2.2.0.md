Version 2.2.0
-------------

Major feature release. New UI and more.

### Features ####
- The User Interface has been rebuilt from the ground up to feel more intuitive and familiar, both the mobile and desktop clients share a more common design langauge and layout now.


- The themeing system has been reworked to be easier to use. A number of inbuilt themes are provided and users can now create their own themes.


- Users now have the option to Undo a delete action performed on a Task, List or personal project. * You cannot undo deleting a shared project *. A toaster banner will appear at the bottom of the window when you perform these actions. If you miss the banner, use the menu in the top right hand corner to Undo your last action.


### Changes ###
- The Local backup system has been removed. The system itself was difficult to maintain when adding new features. I am satisfied that the database and application have been stable enough not to require it any more. 


- The Lock screen has been removed.


- Release notes have been converted to Markdown.


- The Database Sync status indicators have been rolled into a Menu next to the settings Icon with more verbose explanation of the sync status.
